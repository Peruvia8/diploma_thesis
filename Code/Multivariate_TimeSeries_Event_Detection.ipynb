Each timeseries in the dataset consists of 89 observations, each of dimension 14 (and hence multivariate). There are 3 possible labels {0, 1, 2}, where labels 1 and 2 are indicators of event occurrences within the duration of the timeseries and a label of 0 stands for the no-event class. Since both labels 1 and 2 indicate events, they can be interpreted as one label \"positive\" representing one class versus label 0 being indicator of the \"negative class\". Thus, the classification problem can be treated as a binary classification problem where we predict labels as \"positive\" (label 1) or \"negative\" (label 1). Let's get started!

Given that the dataset is slightly imbalanced, boosting would be a more suitable approach here than bagging. That is because boosting ensemble models penalize inaccurate classifications through assigning larger weights to misclassified examples on the go as sequential classifiers are trained on the data. With imbalanced datasets, classifiers tend to lean towards the majority class (in the case of this dataset the positive class) and thus penalizing the examples inaccurately predicted as the majority class would be a great way to deal with this issue, which is exactly what boosting does.\n","\n","As for the choice of the boosting tree, I chose XGBoost over GBM because xgboost is much faster and more efficient computationally. Plus it is more robust to overfitting. In other words, there are several parameters that you can tune which allows for model complexity control.\n","\n","Unlike LSTMs, where you can directly use the reshaped timeseries sequences as inputs to the model, for the tree model, we first need to extract features from the timeseries sequences. Let's start by doing that!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pHvBh0ZnMrqc"},"source":["### Feature Extraction\n","In order to tackle the problem as a classification problem, first step is to come up with a set of features per timeseries instance.

often tackled as an unsupervised learning problem where examples that deviate from the expected behavior of data are detected as anomalies. Datasets containing anomalies generally suffer from class imbalance problem, which we saw earlier in the analysis is the case for this dataset with slight imbalance present. In re-formulating binary classification in imbalanced data as an anomaly detection problem, we can think of the minority class as anomalies in the data and the data belonging to the majority class as regular examples (i.e. not anomalies).\n","\n","Here are some ideas that I have as for how to tackle this data from an outlier detection point of view:\n","\n","### Supervised\n","* Use LSTM/RNN to train a regression (rather than classification) model to perform time series forecast, i.e. predicting feature values in the timeseries data. For each feature in the multivariate time series, make a prediction as for what the next value is going to be - then compare the predicted feature value with the actual value (using groundtruth). Threshold this difference in the two values (would require tuning of this threshold value as a hyperparameter). If the difference exceeds the threshold, that would be indicative of some sort of anomaly/event occuring within the time series and the instance would be detected as an anomaly. For multivariate series, we would also need to come up with a mechanism to combine decisions from the thresholding of the various features in order to label the time series as a whole. The simplest idea would be to do some sort of majority voting, i.e. if the forcasted value for the majority of the features deviates heavily from the actual feature value, label the time series as anomaly.\n","\n","### Unsupervised\n","* Simplest idea is to use clustering techniques such as K-means. A common metric for time series clustering is dynamic time warping (DTW)\n","* SVM's have also been showing to be promising for unsupervised anomaly detection\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
